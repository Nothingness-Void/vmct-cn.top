# Structure generating mods

- Here are some structure mods that are not strictly necessary for the pack. Maybe by removing some/all of them will increase performance?
- You can also remove lootintegrations and lootintegrations_yungs and see if that improves anything.
- fyi if you are playing on the future public server it shouldn't matter if these mods are not installed (I think, haven't tried it myself)
