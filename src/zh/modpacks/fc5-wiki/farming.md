## Farming Crossing Diet Mechanic:

# Summary:

- Whenever you see that you are craving something in the chat. Eat the food with that flavor profile to get random buffs!
- The more cravings you satisfy at a time the more buffs you will get!

# MECHANICS DETAILS

- Instead of balancing the nutrition of your diet, now you get rewarded for satisfying your food cravings!
- This mechanic only ever provides you with buffs, so you don't have to worry about it unless you want to.
- Every food will now be classified on 4 axes:
  - Sweet/Savory
  - Heavy/Light
  - Hot/Cold
  - Dry/Wet
- You can look up foods of a category by typing the category name into JEI!
- If you noticed foods that are missing classifications or are mis-classified. Feel free to submit a suggestion by clicking on the book icon next to this quest!
- If you eat more than 2 of one kind of food, you would start craving food of the opposite kind
  - e.g. if you eaten two cake slices (sweet), then you would start craving something savory
- Cravings can stack! You can eat 2 sweet, heavy, and hot foods to get cravings for savory, light, and cold foods.
- When you eat a food that you are craving for, it will clear all existing potion effects you currently have and give you a random potion effect for each craving you satisfy. The potion effect lasts 20 mins. After that, your cravings will reset.
- You can check your food stats and cravings using the newly added item \Check Food Cravings\
  - You can buy extra copies of this item from the market for 1 ticket
- If you have cravings, you will be notified via chat message when your hunger drops below full or when you ate a food and are still not full
